# What social media platform is most popular among teens? 

Here is an infographic made with [data](https://www.statista.com/statistics/250172/social-network-usage-of-us-teens-and-young-adults/) from Statista that highlights what social media platform is most popular among teens. This data set lists the most popular social media sites from 2012 to 2020. I focused my data on the most popular social media platforms in 2020 because that is the most prevalent information at this time. The data shows that Snapchat is the most popular platform. It also gives key information about the relatively new app Tik Tok which was created in 2016 and gained popularity in 2020 becoming the second most popular platform. It also shows that Instagram which was created in 2010 is the third most popular platform. This data is important because by understanding what social media platforms are most popular among teens advertisers can cultivate advertisements for different platforms to target different groups. Outreach programs specializing in mental health and anti-bullying campaigns can also use this information to reach the most teenagers and spread their message through niche content. I found this data after looking through different sources specializing in social media data.

# National Norms for ACT Test Scores 
This chart was made with chartbuilder using data that can be accessed [here](https://www.act.org/content/dam/act/unsecured/documents/MultipleChoiceStemComposite.pdf). The motivation behind finding this data is the importance of understanding composite ACT scores and how well students are performing. This data illustrates the national rank for a certain ACT score. This means that 53% of recent high school graduates who took the ACT achieved a Composte score of 20 or bellow and so on. This information is important because the reader can pay attention to national averages which gives them a solid understanding of how scores range especially with lower scores. The take home message is that there is a range of how well students perform on the ACT and it shows that more than half of the students who take the ACT receive a 20 or lower. This data is important because it shows what percentage of students received a certain score and from that researchers can look closely at the demographics of these different percentages to see what influences scores.

# Party Environment at Lehigh 
Here are two charts discussing different aspects of partying at Lehigh University. They both take data from a survey conducted asking participants questions involving the partying culture at Lehigh. The first graph highlights what parties different groups drink more for either on-campus or off-campus. The groups are separated into Greek Fraternity or Sorority, Neither, and Varsity Athletes. The second graph highlights gender differences and party safety. This question distinguished if males or females ever feel unsafe at an off-campus party. These two graphs tell important information about what parties students drink more for and if females or males feel more unsafe at parties. The first graph shows that all groups of students are more likely to drink more on campus, with 36.7% of greek members saying they drink more for on-campus parties. The second graph depicts that 32.55% of females have never felt unsafe at parties while 21.05% have felt unsafe at an off-campus party; 24.17% of males said they have never felt unsafe and 22.22% have said they have felt unsafe. This is interesting because it shows that males have felt unsafe at parties more often than females. This data is important because it depicts statistics in a way that is easy to understand. It is also important to understand when students are drinking more alcohol and whether or not Lehigh students feel safe at parties. This data can be utilized to make changes and create a safe drinking environment for students.

# Worldwide COVID-19 Data

This data set provides data of COVID-19 cases around the world including how many active COVID-19 cases each Country has and how many deaths and recoveries there have been. This data was updated on November 3, 2021, and was found through multiple sources that record COVID-19 statistics. The original data set can be found [here.](https://www.kaggle.com/anandhuh/covid19-in-world-countrieslatest-data.) 

This project lays out clearly the relationship between different numbers affected by COVID-19. The first visualization shows the relationship between how many active cases, deaths, and recoveries each country is experiencing as of November 2, 2021. The most important takeaway from this data is that the US has the most active cases. The second visualization shows the relationship between how many tests a country has administered and the total cases/deaths. The bigger the circle the more active cases the more deaths there have been. The US, UK, and Russia are lading with the most deaths.
