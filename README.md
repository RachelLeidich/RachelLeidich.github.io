# What social media platform is most popular among teens? 

Here is an infographic made with [data](https://www.statista.com/statistics/250172/social-network-usage-of-us-teens-and-young-adults/) from Statista that highlights what social media platform is most popular among teens. This data set lists the most popular social media sites from 2012 to 2020. I focused my data on the most popular social media platforms in 2020 because that is the most prevalent information at this time. The data shows that Snapchat is the most popular platform. It also gives key information about the relatively new app Tik Tok which was created in 2016 and gained popularity in 2020 becoming the second most popular platform. It also shows that Instagram which was created in 2010 is the third most popular platform. This data is important because by understanding what social media platforms are most popular among teens advertisers can cultivate advertisements for different platforms to target different groups. Outreach programs specializing in mental health and anti-bullying campaigns can also use this information to reach the most teenagers and spread their message through niche content. I found this data after looking through different sources specializing in social media data.

# National Norms for ACT Test Scores 
This chart was made with chartbuilder using data that can be accessed [here](https://www.act.org/content/dam/act/unsecured/documents/MultipleChoiceStemComposite.pdf). The motivation behind finding this data is the importance of understanding composite ACT scores and how well students are performing. This data illustrates the national rank for a certain ACT score. This means that 53% of recent high school graduates who took the ACT achieved a Composte score of 20 or bellow and so on. This information is important because the reader can pay attention to national averages which gives them a solid understanding of how scores range especially with lower scores. The take home message is that there is a range of how well students perform on the ACT and it shows that more than half of the students who take the ACT receive a 20 or lower. This data is important because it shows what percentage of students received a certain score and from that researchers can look closely at the demographics of these different percentages to see what influences scores.
